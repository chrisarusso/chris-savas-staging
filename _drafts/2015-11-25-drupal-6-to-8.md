summary: What to plan for as Drupal 6 EOL approaches.

## The issue at <img src="/assets/img/hand.png" alt="hand">

As most Drupal 6 site owners are aware, after a prolonged development period, Drupal 8 had an official release ([8.0.0]((https://www.drupal.org/node/2619030))) last week on November 19th, 2015
[Dries's birthday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dries_Buytaert) with a corresponding many, many a lively party: <img src="/assets/img/celebr8d8.jpg" alt="Drupal 8 celebration #celebr8d8"> 
<caption>Like this fancy one in downtown Durham.</caption> 

As many know, with the official release of Drupal 8, 
support for Drupal 6 will soon end. How soon you ask? [February 24th, 2016](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6-eol). Given the holiday 
season has basically begun while I write this, there is little time left to undertake a site upgrade before Drupal 6 EOL. If you are a site owner fortunate enough to have survived a Drupal site
upgrade in the past, you may well be aware that for sites with custom code or complex configuration, the upgrade process can be time-intensive. It is never as easy as the click of a button. For most in this position, it is the fact
that their site(s) _are_ so complex that they have avoided going through the upgrade process as long as possible.

This presents responsible yet practical site owners who don't have unlimited budgets with complex factors to ponder and pros and cons to weigh. In part 1 of this series, we'll help walk you through the following topics at a high-level, 
 with a separate post for a deeper dive for each.

### What does Drupal 6 EOL mean for me?

Like any good (and bad probably) Drupal advisor will tell you, it all depends. Understanding your level of risk means understanding your organization and your website from a very technical level.
As an agency that leverages open source technology to build modern web applications, on a daily basis we're rely on the Newtonian 
> shoulders of giants
to perform sophisticated tasks with the click of a button (or more likely a command in the terminal). The same community we pull from and contribute to for features provides security maintenance. 

+ Part of how we develop is we leverage open source community. Other people's (and sometimes our) 
 hard work at addressing bugs and security vulnerabilities can be rectified on a site with
 the click of the button (or more realistically one command on the terminal). That ability goes
 away after software is not supported
 Some factors to consider
 + How well-known is your organization? Larger organizations with higher levels of traffic are especially targeted
 + How many contributed modules does my site use?
 + How many custom modules does my site use?
 
### What are the risks


High level risks, more clearly stated in part 2 areRisks for using unsupported software I'll categorize in two primary ways, and discuss in more detail in part 2. 

1. Site owners expose themselves to risk from public attack over the internet due to vulnerabilities exposed by website code. 
1. Opportunity costs of using old software means more limited feature-set and less-able development pool. 


+ You will experience complete site compromise in which a malicious 
+ Less severe, pesky mandatory server upgrades hosts often undergo to protect their security
+ You do not keep up with modern web development practices. After all, Drupal 6 came out in 1975 ([I just checked](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6.0)) and given that makes it older than 6 months on the web, it'a ancient.
+ You expose yourself to a decreasing market of developers that are able to serve you. With each major release, especially two in row (7 and 8) with significant architectural modifications to the former, skills used in current versions
of software are less transferable to older versions. 


+ Drupalgeddon
+ Less severe, pesky mandatory server upgrades hosts often undergo to protect their security
+ Not keeping up with modern web
+ Not having access to proficient/modern developers
 
### What are my options in layman terms?
+ In discussing this very idea with an existing client, he well articulated the options he felt he had as a site owner
 + Do nothing, and keep your fingers crossed
 + Upgrade to match existing functionality
 + Engage a full-on redesign, harden the site for vulnerabilities as best as possible
 + Upgrade to Drupal 7
 + Upgrade to Drupal 8
 
+ Speak to perspectives out there.
+ Measured approach


### What is our recommendation

If you feel lost answering some of these questions, it's probably best that you speak with a professional who 
has demonstrated years of experience maintaining and upgrading Drupal sites. The upgrade process 
is a highly variable one, and is not especially easy to estimate, especially for those with limited
experience in doing it. It is a time that we encourage clients to look at the process like moving into a new house. 
Given a lot of effort is involved in the move, it's best to envision what you want in the new space, not so much
trying to replicate what you had in the old space, that you're intentionally moving away from after all! There are advanced
techniques to migrate the content that you may want from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 or Drupal 8 that don't need to carry along
all the cruft you may be better leaving behind.



### Why are we a good option?

Key points

 + There are many others in your shoes
 + Upgrading Drupal is non-trivial so if you're convinced of security implications, seriously consider a comprehensive rebuild
   + Also, your old site probably does stuff you don't want to do anymore, consider D8 for simpler sites
   + Discuss upgrade options
 + Sort of depends on your risk tolerance and how much of a target you are likely to be
   + Caveat is that advanced hacker networks likely have much of the web mapped in that they know what software a corresponding
   URL is on, and can target publicly (or not) known exploits to hit those sites
  + Great thing about Drupal, there are lots of good resources out there
  + Reference Drupalgeddon - every site in the world was destroyed within 7 minutes
