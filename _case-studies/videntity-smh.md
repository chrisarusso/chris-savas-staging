project_objective: |
  The client needed a prototype to leverage for user testing of scenarios involving a complex member approval process. So we set out to build a prototype that felt real for the user during testing and one that demonstrated to product stakeholders the power of the eventual product. Within a quick timeline, we aimed to deliver prototype code that the client could reuse on the final product.
project_process: |
  We leveraged _Create React App_ to quickly spin up a React app and used session storage to store variables for things like mimicking authentication and stepping through the member approval process. Keeping our code modular, we were able to ensure that components easily translated to the eventual Django app. We utilized modular styles, and react-bootstrap so that SCSS code could be reused as-is. We were also able to ensure that the prototype met accessibility standards, making the code even more reusable.
project_results: |
  Partnering with product design shop Clade, we built a prototype more functional and realistic than the client expected given the short two-week sprint. We delivered organized, modular, and maintainable code for use in the final application. In the end, the client was happy, and we exceeded their expectations.
