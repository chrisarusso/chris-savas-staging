Brian has been working with Drupal since early 2006, providing technical leadership on projects ranging from small non-profit websites to multi-million user publication and media industry applications. In addition to Drupal, Brian leverages other frameworks and bespoke engineering as required to provide the best solutions for our partners. Brian enjoys implementing microservice architectures while pushing the boundaries of scalability and performance with the best tools of the modern web.

Outside of work, Brian enjoys his small hobby farm with his family near Ottawa, Ontario where he currently keeps chickens, bees and soon beef cattle. He also keeps busy with his old project tractor (1977 Massey 240), truck (1988 Ford F250) and car (1983 Mercedes 500SEC).
