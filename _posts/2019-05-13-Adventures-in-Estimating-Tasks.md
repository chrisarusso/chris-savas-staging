Good project management starts with accurate project time estimation. This is important for several reasons:

1. Accurate time estimates assist in setting milestones and managing capacity when project planning.
2. The accuracy (or lack thereof) of your time assessment will inform other's perception of your reliability and competence as a project manager/company.
3. Time estimates almost always determine the pricing of contracts and therefore profitability of your company. 

### Bottom line: Time estimations matter. A lot.

It’s all too common to underestimate the amount of time needed for a project. Often, this is due to unanticipated challenges, requests for additional features, or unscheduled urgent tasks that occasionally pop up. Even so, estimates remain a key to success in any company—most especially ours, and we strive to keep them accurate 

Other things to keep in mind when considering estimates:

* Estimates are different from proposals or contracts (read: we estimate in time, not dollars)
* Estimates are not definites
* Good estimates take time, discovery, and vetting
* Estimates are important to both planning and profitability

**Something to be wary of: [The Planning Fallacy](https://www.fastcompany.com/90313102/how-to-get-better-at-estimating-your-time)**

The Planning Fallacy is failing to consider how long it’s taken to complete similar tasks in the past and/or assuming that we won’t run into any complications that will cause delays.

After a deep dive into our past time estimates(for a presentation at our recent **[ReTreat Yo Self](https://savaslabs.com/2019/04/08/savas-retreat-yo-self.html)** team retreat) and comparing to our actual spent time we concluded that as a company

* We like even numbers! (We also love a good **[palindrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome)**, hence our name)
* We’ve done a pretty good job, but as always, there is room for improvement.

**Fight the planning fallacy:**

The biggest challenge we (and  the majority, I imagine) face is the planning fallacy. So, here are a few suggestions for fighting the planning fallacy (adapted from **[this helpful article](https://www.fastcompany.com/90313102/how-to-get-better-at-estimating-your-time)** and my own experience):

1. **Data talks.** And history tends to repeat itself. So use historical data to help make the most accurate estimations.
2. **Do three estimates.** Best-case, worst-case, and most likely. Pro tip: assume your initial estimate is “best-case”.
3. **Check the calendar.** Take into account the big picture. What other projects will you be working on at these same times? Who will be on vacation and unable to work on the project for a week?
4. **Think in “Work Weeks”.** When we think of how many days we have until a project is due, we often think in actual days not in “work days”. Count only the Monday-Friday days in your estimation. More on **[Ro’s](https://savaslabs.com/company/ro-wang/)** idea of “Work Weeks” coming soon.
5. **FUDGE it!** Use a fudge ratio:
	- Estimate the time it will take to do near-future tasks.
	- Track the actual time.
	- Sum the estimates and the actual spent time.
	- Divide the total spent time by the total estimated time.
	
	Voilà! A fudge ratio! Apply that to future estimates.
6. **Phone a friend.** Call on a co-worker or another project manager. When estimating a project they aren’t working on, they are likely to give a far more realistic estimation than you would.
7. **1 word: RANGES**. Don’t estimate in perfect numbers, give a range to account for unknowns.
8. **Started from the bottom and now...** Estimate at the low point of your day. This is to say, don’t do estimations when you’ve just had the most delicious lunch, your calendar is free, your inbox is near-empty and you’re feeling high on life. You’ll be feeling over-optimistic about everything, including your time estimations.
9. **Revisit**. After wading into a project, take a look back and revisit initial estimates. You know what they say: “measure twice, cut once."

Setting more accurate time expectations is better for everyone because we create the necessary space—and far less anxiety and pressure—to do better quality work. It creates reliability for the client, for ourselves and our coworkers and generally keeps everything running smoothly.
