On Thursday March 17, about thirty [TriDUG](https://groups.drupal.org/tridug) members gathered to for a discussion on using Drupal 8.

I presented on my experiences building [Durham Atlético](https://www.durhamatletico.com) using all the Drupal 8 features we're growing to love: configuration management, new theming layer, Views in core, the vastly improved content editing experience, and the Symfony2 underpinnings of Drupal's architecture.

[Anne](/company/anne-tomasevich) gave a tour of the theming layer (she did some [amazing work building the theme](https://github.com/durhamatletico/durhamatletico-cms/graphs/contributors) for the Durham Atlético site) and talked up the benefits of using Twig over the old PHP-based templating system in Drupal 7. If you'd like to know more about Drupal 8 theming, we have a great set of [introductory articles here](/blog/tag/theming/).

Thanks to everyone who attended, we're looking forward to seeing you all at the next TriDUG meetup!
