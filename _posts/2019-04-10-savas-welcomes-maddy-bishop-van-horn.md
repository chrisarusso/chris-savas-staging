Faithful readers of the Savas Blog, please welcome Maddy to the Savas Team! :wave: We are so excited that she’s here!

Maddy comes to us from premier Digital Agency, [Viget](https://viget.com), by way of [Engineering World Health](https://ewh.org)—a non-profit that uses the skills of students and professionals to improve health care in low-income countries. During her time there, she traveled the globe managing teams of student-engineers working on medical equipment in places like Rwanda, Nepal, and Cambodia—how awesome is that?!!

Maddy has project management skills like you wouldn’t believe and we knew she would be a perfect fit for the Savas Labs Team ([Think you could be the perfect fit, too? You’re in luck, we’re hiring!](https://savaslabs.com/careers/)). Her attention to detail, organizational skills, and self-motivated nature a great partner on any project and we’re excited for [current partners](https://savaslabs.com/results/) and [new clients](https://savaslabs.com/services/) to get the chance to meet Maddy. We know they will be as impressed as we are!

Fun fact: Maddy’s very first day on the job wasn’t from [our Durham, NC office](https://savaslabs.com/contact/) where she works from, but spent on a plane flying to [our latest Team Retreat](https://savaslabs.com/2019/04/08/savas-retreat-yo-self.html)—in Austin, Texas! Talk about an exciting first day!

Another fun fact about Maddy: She’s a foster dog mom. She’s making an impact in her community by [http://www.carolinaadoptabulls.com](fostering dogs) and loving them well until (and after) they find a fur-ever home.

Maddy, we are glad you’re here!
