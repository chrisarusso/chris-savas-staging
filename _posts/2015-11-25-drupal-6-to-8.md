summary: What to do with Drupal 6 after official security support.

---

## The issue at <img src="/assets/img/hand.png" alt="hand">
As most Drupal 6 site owners are aware, after many, many moons, [Drupal 8.0.0](https://www.drupal.org/node/2619030) had an official release on November 19th, 2015
[Dries's birthday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dries_Buytaert) with a corresponding many, many a party [add image from our party]. Many Drupal 6 site owners also know that with the official release of Drupal 8, 
support for Drupal 6 will soon end. How soon you ask? [February 24th, 2016](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6-eol). Given the holiday 
season has basically begun while I write this, that doesn't leave much time remaining for anyone running anything 
more complex than a brochureware site to upgrade their sites to Drupal 7 or 8 from 6. For most who find themselves in this position, it is the fact
that their site(s) _are_ so complex that they have avoided going through the potentially painful and expensive upgrade process.

This presents prudent and practical site owners in this situation who do not have infinite budgets with complex decisions to ponder.
Let's help walk you through what it really means, some risks, some options
Note: if you don't fit into the above categorization, and your budget is infinite, please [contact us immediately](/contact). ;)

### What does Drupal 6 EOL mean for me?
+ Part of how we develop is we leverage open source community. Other people's (and sometimes our) 
 hard work at addressing bugs and security vulnerabilities can be rectified on a site with
 the click of the button (or more realistically one command on the terminal). That ability goes
 away after software is not supported
 
### What are my options in layman terms?
+ In discussing this very idea with an existing client, he well articulated the options he felt he had as a site owner
 + Do nothing, and keep your fingers crossed
 + Upgrade to match existing functionality
 + Engage a full-on redesign, harden the site for vulnerabilities as best as possible
 
 
### What are your options?

+ Speak to perspectives out there.

+ Measured approach

### What are the risks

+ Drupalgeddon
+ Less severe, pesky mandatory server upgrades hosts often undergo to protect their security


### Why are we a good option?

Key points

 + There are many others in your shoes
 + Upgrading Drupal is non-trivial so if you're convinced of security implications, seriously consider a comprehensive rebuild
   + Also, your old site probably does stuff you don't want to do anymore, consider D8 for simpler sites
   + Discuss upgrade options
 + Sort of depends on your risk tolerance and how much of a target you are likely to be
   + Caveat is that advanced hacker networks likely have much of the web mapped in that they know what software a corresponding
   URL is on, and can target publicly (or not) known exploits to hit those sites
  + Great thing about Drupal, there are lots of good resources out there
  + Reference Drupalgeddon - every site in the world was destroyed within 7 minutes
  + stomach hurts - https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6-eol#comment-10556816
  + some are on Drupal 5! How about Drupal 4.
