summary: What to plan for as Drupal 6 EOL approaches.

## The issue at <img src="/assets/img/hand.png" alt="hand">

As most Drupal 6 site owners are aware, after a prolonged development period, Drupal 8 had an official release ([8.0.0]((https://www.drupal.org/node/2619030))) last week on November 19th, 2015
[Dries's birthday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dries_Buytaert) with a corresponding many, many a lively party: <img src="/assets/img/celebr8d8.jpg" alt="Drupal 8 celebration #celebr8d8"> 
<caption>Like this fancy one in downtown Durham.</caption> 

This is a [**BIG DEAL**](http://celebratedrupal8.com/) and generally speaking is great for the community of Drupal site owners and site makers.

However (there's always a but), as many know, with the official release of Drupal 8, 
support for Drupal 6 will soon end. How soon you ask? [February 24th, 2016](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6-eol). Given the U.S. holiday 
season has begun, there is little time left to undertake a site upgrade before Drupal 6 End Of Life (EOL). If you are a site owner fortunate enough to have survived a Drupal site
upgrade in the past, you may be well aware that the upgrade process can be time-intensive for complex sites. It is _never_ as easy as the click of a button. For most Drupal 6 site owners, it _is_ the fact
that their site(s) _are_ so complex that they have avoided going through the upgrade process for as long as possible.

This presents **responsible** yet **practical** site owners who don't have unlimited budgets with complex factors to ponder and pros and cons to weigh. In **part 1 of this series**, we'll help walk you through the following topics at a high-level, 
 with a separate post for a deeper dive for each.
 
 + What does Drupal 6 EOL mean for me?
 + What are the risks to not upgrading? 
 + What are my options / what do you recommend?
 
**NB**: if you don't fit into the aforementioned category of having budgetary constraints, please [**contact us immediately**](/contact). ;)

### What does Drupal 6 EOL mean for me?

Like any good (and probably the bad too) Drupal advisor will tell you, **it all depends**. Helpful, right? But truly, it's necessary to understand well the organization and its 
technical requirements to assess the risk of operating a Drupal 6 site after EOL.
As an agency that leverages open source technology to build modern web applications, on a daily basis we rely on the Newtonian 

> ...shoulders of giants...

to perform sophisticated tasks with the click of a button (or more likely a command in the terminal). The community that we pull from and contribute to for features is the same one that provides security maintenance. Drupal 6
has been around for a long time. As of mid November 2015 there are at least ~125,000 reported instances (likely underrepresented) of Drupal 6 sites. So you are not alone. I am here with you. 

If you're reading this and have not begun your upgrade process yet, it is **very** likely you will be spending at least some time outside of support for your Drupal 6 site. We will dive into this at a deeper level in a follow up post
but some of the factors that are worth taking into consideration as your strategize are:

+ How well-known is your organization? Larger organizations with high public profiles are systematically targeted more frequently than smaller, lesser-known organizations.
+ How many contributed modules does my site use and how well supported are those modules?
  + Attack vectors that remain for Drupal 6 are likely to be modules that have not received a lot of historical support, but are in some way identifiable to the public when they are in use on a site.
+ How much custom code does my site use?
  + Custom code has the advantage of not being publicly known, but the large disadvantage of only being vetted by one site
 
### What are the risks?

Risks for using unsupported software I'll categorize in two primary ways, and discuss in more detail in part 2. 

1. Site owners expose themselves to risk from public attack over the internet due to poor code. 
1. Opportunity costs of using old software means worse features and less-able development pool. 


+ You will experience complete site compromise in which a malicious 
+ Less severe, pesky mandatory server upgrades hosts often undergo to protect their security
+ You do not keep up with modern web development practices. After all, Drupal 6 came out in 1975 ([I just checked](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6.0)) and given that makes it older than 6 months on the web, it'a ancient.
+ You expose yourself to a decreasing market of developers that are able to serve you. With each major release, especially two in row (7 and 8) with significant architectural modifications to the former, skills used in current versions
of software are less transferable to older versions. 

 
### What are my options?

In discussing this very idea with an existing client, he well articulated the options he felt he had as a Drupal 6 site owner. They are roughly:
 + Do nothing, and keep your fingers crossed.
 + Upgrade Drupal 6 core to a supported version (probably Drupal 7) and match existing functionality.
 + Use the timing as an opportunity to engage a robust redesign/rebuild (Drupal 7 or 8) which may not be production-ready until late 2016 or early 2017 while simultaneously hardening the site limiting attack vulnerabilities.
 + Select a different solution than Drupal, and migrate to that

### What is our recommendation?

If you feel lost answering some of these questions, it's best that you speak with a professional who 
has years of experience maintaining and upgrading Drupal sites. The upgrade process 
is a highly variable one, and is not especially easy to estimate as it is much more nuanced than typical feature development. 
 
It is a time that we encourage site owners to look at the process like **moving into a new and better house**. 
Given a lot of effort is involved in the move, it's best to envision what you want in the new space, not so much what you had in the old.
Why make a carbon copy when you had good reasons to make the move after all even if you were technologically strong-armed!? 

There are advanced
techniques to migrate the content that you may want from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 or Drupal 8 that don't need to carry along
all the cruft you may be better leaving behind. 

We especially love talking through these options as we have been building sites in Drupal 8 since May 2015 and can provide prospective
on it's readiness which is largely dependent on the organizational and technological requirements.
