summary: What to do when running a Drupal 6 site after EOL.

---

## The issue at <img src="/assets/img/hand.png" alt="hand">
As most Drupal 6 site owners are aware, after many, many moons, [Drupal 8.0.0](https://www.drupal.org/node/2619030) had an official release on November 19th, 2015
[Dries's birthday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dries_Buytaert) with a corresponding many, many a party [add image from our party]. Many Drupal 6 site owners also know that with the official release of Drupal 8, 
support for Drupal 6 will soon end. How soon you ask? [February 24th, 2016](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6-eol). Given the holiday 
season has basically begun while I write this, that doesn't leave much time remaining for anyone running anything 
more complex than a brochureware site to upgrade her site(s) to Drupal 7 or 8 from 6. For most in this position, it is the fact
that their site(s) _are_ so complex that they have avoided going through the potentially painful and expensive upgrade process.

This presents prudent and practical site owners in this situation who do not have infinite budgets with complex decisions to ponder
and pros and cons to weigh.
Let's help walk you through what EOL for Drupal 6 really means, some related risks, and the options that you have.

NB: if you don't fit into the aforementioned category of having budgetary constraints, please [**contact us immediately**](/contact). ;)

### What does Drupal 6 EOL mean for me?
+ Part of how we develop is we leverage open source community. Other people's (and sometimes our) 
 hard work at addressing bugs and security vulnerabilities can be rectified on a site with
 the click of the button (or more realistically one command on the terminal). That ability goes
 away after software is not supported
 Some factors to consider
 + How well-known is your organization? Larger organizations with higher levels of traffic are especially targeted
 + How many contributed modules does my site use?
 + How many custom modules does my site use?
 
### What are my options in layman terms?
+ In discussing this very idea with an existing client, he well articulated the options he felt he had as a site owner
 + Do nothing, and keep your fingers crossed
 + Upgrade to match existing functionality
 + Engage a full-on redesign, harden the site for vulnerabilities as best as possible
 
+ Speak to perspectives out there.
+ Measured approach

### What are the risks

+ Drupalgeddon
+ Less severe, pesky mandatory server upgrades hosts often undergo to protect their security

### What is our recommendation

+ If you feel lost answering some of these questions, you need to speak with a professional who 
has demonstrated years of experience maintaining and upgrading Drupal sites. The upgrade process 
is a highly variable one, and is not especially easy to estimate, especially for those with limited
experience in doing it.


### Why are we a good option?

Key points

 + There are many others in your shoes
 + Upgrading Drupal is non-trivial so if you're convinced of security implications, seriously consider a comprehensive rebuild
   + Also, your old site probably does stuff you don't want to do anymore, consider D8 for simpler sites
   + Discuss upgrade options
 + Sort of depends on your risk tolerance and how much of a target you are likely to be
   + Caveat is that advanced hacker networks likely have much of the web mapped in that they know what software a corresponding
   URL is on, and can target publicly (or not) known exploits to hit those sites
  + Great thing about Drupal, there are lots of good resources out there
  + Reference Drupalgeddon - every site in the world was destroyed within 7 minutes
