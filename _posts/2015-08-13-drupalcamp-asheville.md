## Drupalcamp Asheville, we're coming!
Savas Labs will be represented at [Drupalcamp Asheville](http://www.drupalasheville.com) this year! Anne and [Chris](/company/chris-russo/) are both presenting. Anne will present on Drupal 8 theming, roughly based off her [blog post about it](/2015/06/10/d8-theming-basics.html), a topic with very little reliable information out there in the wild, and Chris is presenting on his "personal git workflow, for everyone," which is also based off a [blog post he wrote recently](/2015/07/09/personal-git-workflow.html).

We're excited to head to beautiful Asheville to teach, share and learn. We
might even get a hike in and some craft beer while we're at it.
